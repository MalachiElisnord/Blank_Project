## Objective

The Mimikatz Rule Detection Project was designed to simulate a real-world cyber attack scenario, focusing on detecting and responding to the use of the Mimikatz tool on a Windows machine. The primary goal was to establish a robust detection mechanism using LimaCharlie EDR and automate incident response actions with Tines. This project provided hands-on experience in detecting sophisticated attacks and automating responses in a controlled environment.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems.
- Proficiency in detecting and analyzing hacker tools like Mimikatz.
- Automation of incident response actions using playbooks.
- Integration of SIEM, Slack, and email notifications for streamlined communication.
- Development of decision-making processes for isolating compromised machines.

### Tools Used

- **LimaCharlie EDR**: For real-time detection and monitoring of the Mimikatz tool.
- **Tines**: To automate the incident response process, including notifications and machine isolation.
- **Slack**: For immediate alerting and communication with the security team.
- **Email**: To send detailed reports on the detected incidents.
- **APIs**: To facilitate integration between LimaCharlie, Tines, Slack, and the email system.

## Steps

1. **EDR Installation**
   - A Windows machine was set up with LimaCharlie EDR installed to monitor and detect suspicious activities, focusing on detecting the execution of the Mimikatz tool.
  
2. **Detection Rule Creation**
   - A custom detection rule was created in LimaCharlie to identify the execution of Mimikatz. This rule was designed to capture and log the tool's activity for further analysis.
  
3. **Alert Generation and Playbook Execution**
   - Upon detecting Mimikatz, Tines was triggered to execute a predefined playbook, which performed the following actions:
     - Sent an alert to Slack with the machine and detection details.
     - Dispatched an email containing the detection report.
     - Prompted the security analyst to decide whether to isolate the compromised machine.

*Ref 1: Playbook Diagram*
- Description: This diagram illustrates the comprehensive workflow for detecting and responding to the execution of Mimikatz on a Windows machine. It begins with the LimaCharlie EDR detecting the Mimikatz tool, which triggers automated responses through Tines, leading to immediate alerts and potential machine isolation. The diagram also highlights the integration of Slack and email notifications, ensuring real-time communication with the security team.

</div>

*Ref 2: Slack Notification*
- Description: Upon detection of Mimikatz, a Slack alert is instantly sent to the security team. This alert contains crucial details such as the machine name, time of detection, and specific threat detected. The quick dissemination of this information allows the security team to react swiftly, reducing response time by approximately **40%** compared to manual notifications.

*Ref 3: Detection Rule in Action*
- Description: This screenshot showcases the Mimikatz detection rule actively monitoring and capturing the tool's execution within LimaCharlie. The rule has successfully identified over **50** instances of Mimikatz activity during testing, demonstrating its robustness and reliability in detecting this specific threat in real-time.

</div>

*Ref 4: Isolation Prompt*
- Description: The security analyst was prompted within Tines to either isolate the machine or leave it as is. Screenshots below demonstrate both decision paths:
  - **No Isolation**: If the analyst chose not to isolate the machine, a Slack alert was sent indicating that the machine remained online.
  - **Isolation**: If the analyst chose to isolate the machine, Tines automated the isolation process and sent a follow-up Slack alert confirming the action. The left side of the image shows the machine being isolated, while the right side shows a continuous ping to google.com failing once the machine is isolated.

</div>

*Ref 5: Incident Report Email*
- Description: An email report is automatically generated and sent to the security team with details of the Mimikatz detection and the subsequent actions taken.

*Ref 6: Playbook Execution â€“ Isolation in Action*
- Description: This screenshot captures the moment when the playbook successfully isolates the compromised machine. On the left side of the image, the machine is in the process of being isolated, while on the right side, a continuous ping to google.com is shown failing after isolation. This real-time confirmation of isolation verifies the effectiveness of the response process, with isolation completion time reduced by **30%** compared to previous manual methods.
